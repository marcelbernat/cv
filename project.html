    <h1>Conrad Connect</h1>
    <h3>Corporate website for an innovative IoT platform which helps the users to unlock the full potential of their smart devices.</h3>
    <h5>UX RESEARCH, UX/UI DESIGN</h5>
    <p>The main issue was a low performance of marketing pages and problems with them as the main channel letting users know about the platform. There was not a clear web structure and the interface was not user-friendly. The visuals were based on Shutterstock pictures. Also, the website was not fully responsive and this lead to a really big problem since 65% of users had access to the website from their mobile devices.</p>
